# Week 2 - Assignment

**Turn in your GitHub repository URL into Canvas solo or in pairs (if the Github repository is private please add fanneyyy, kthorri and ironpeak as collaborators)**
**Turn in password for hgop user in Jenkins(see below) as a comment with the URL**

Each Day is worth 30 points, 120 points in total. You need 100 points to get a full grade so even though you don't get
everything completely working you have some room for error.

Your repository should be a fork from the tictactoe-student, and contain the following as well:

- scripts and/or steps used to set up jenkins in a readme file. Document in jenkins.md in the root. jenkins.md should include the following:
  - links to scripts used to set up jenkins.
  - link (URL) to jenkins instance. NOTE: Password with the *repository* URL (see above).
  - other steps taken to make Jenkins work. 

- testExamples.md (day 7 assignment)
- Implementation of game logic and tests in placeholder files in the project.
- Jenkinsfile to glue the build steps together, including deployment.

Make sure that your jenkins instance is open to the RU network in the EC2 security group. Add credentials hgop/<somepassword> to Jenkins, and send 
the password to the teachers using a comment with the repository URL in Canvas.

###PS:
